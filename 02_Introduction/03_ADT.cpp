/*
 * Abstract Data Types
 * 
 * 1. Representation of Data
 * 
 * How are you storing the data?
 * 
 * 2. Operation on Data
 * 
 * What operations do you allow on that data?
 * 
 * When you talk about a data type you are talking about both its representation
 * and the operations on that data type (mainly its operations).
 * 
 * Abstract means to "hide internal details".
