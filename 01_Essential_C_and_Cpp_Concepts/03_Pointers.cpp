/*
 * Pointers
 * 
 * Pointers are address variables that refer to a specific address in memory. Pointers are
 * used for indirectly accessing data. Why would you need to access data indirectly?
 * 
 * In memory, a program is divided into 3 parts: The code section, stack section, and heap
 * section. Heap memory is stored outside the program. One of the reasons to use a pointer
 * is to access memory stored outside of the program, in the heap. The main reason to use a
 * pointer is to access resources which exist outside of a program. Pointers are also used
 * in passing parameters.
 * 
 * 1. Accessing heap memory.
 * 2. Accessing resources.
 * 3. Passing parameters.
